### About DLA
- **DLA** (Deep Learning Accelerator), is a flexible DNN processing engine opened by NVDIA. We have revised this open source with several features, including the support of MobileNet Series, weight decompression of convolution / fully-connected operations, and various customize options for users. However, abovementioned revisions are under our commercial license, not inside this open project. This project is a basic revision that is close to the original open-source version.

### Our Purpose
- The OpenDLA here is the basic one, 64-MAC version, which is originally named nv_small in NVDIA's open source. Here we provide the synthesizable codes and project files for popular Xilinx MPSOC FPGA Series. We hope this may create an easy entrance for DNN edge implementation whether in academic or industrial. Also, this can be a fast way to evaluate our services.
